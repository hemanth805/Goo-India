How To Generate a /etc/passwd password hash via the Command Line on Linux
Mattias Geniar, Monday, October 26, 2015

If you're looking to generate the /etc/shadow hash for a password for a Linux user (for instance: to use in a Puppet manifest), you can easily generate one at the command line.

$ openssl passwd -1
Password:
Verifying - Password:
$1$3JUKmV3R$vZVeb51f1t6QZUecwuRHX0

If you want to pass along a salt to your password;

$ openssl passwd -1 -salt yoursalt
Password:
$1$yoursalt$5WA5NN0quMJ62v5LCu8kj1

The above examples all prompt your password, so it won't be visible in the history of the server or in the process listing. If you want to directly pass the password as a parameter, use one of these examples.

$ openssl passwd -1
Password:
Verifying - Password:
$1$rr7ygbpo$v.zYy4J3/B73NF/qsrDZJ0

$ echo 'joske' | openssl passwd -1 -stdin
$1$8HOL7Lpu$wYO7x5kUDw39GfQaVqelP/
